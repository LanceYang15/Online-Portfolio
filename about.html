          My name is Lance Yang and welcome to my online portfolio, I am a software developer who likes to get things finished. Having goals are very important to me, it gives me reason to get out of bed and accomplish what needs to be accomplished. The thing about having goals is that you are able to break it down into smaller segments, so if any problems were to arise it would be contained within that segment which helps out a lot when trying to find a solution. Also I like it when I complete the smaller segments because it means that I'm getting closer to finishing a goal.

          I have created this web page with mobile first in mind, with the use of "Visual Studio Code" as my text editor, it's actually my first time using this text editor and so far so good, I have no complaints. Bootstrap 4 is also being used, and was recently released as well (2018 Jan 18), I thought to myself and decided to get use to the new technologies and to create this web page with it.

          On my free time I like to exercise when possible, I have finally found out what works for me! When it comes to video games I do like to play "The Last of Us" on multiplayer mode, and also "Stree Fighter V" since I grew up with the Street Fighter series. But I have to say some of my favourite things to do would have to be eating (burgers are awesome), and a game of table tennis or as some would say ping pong.
